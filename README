Dependencies:
	alsactl, bash, sed

Installation:
	Copy aconfswitch script to your preferred folder and make it available through PATH
	variable. You can create a symbolic link in /usr/bin or add the path to aconfswitch
	script to your PATH variable.
	Make sure the script is executable by issuing:

		chmod +x aconfswitch

	Create a folder containing your alsa configuration files within your home directory,
	so every user can have its own configuration files.

		mkdir ~/.alsapresets/

	To create configuration files, edit your current configuration in the way you want to
	have the new preset, e.g. use alsamixer to set the volume of the individual speakers.
	After finishing configuration, store your current configuration to a file by executing:

		alsactl -f ~/.alsapresets/[PRESETNAME].conf

	Replace [PRESETNAME] with your preferred preset name.
